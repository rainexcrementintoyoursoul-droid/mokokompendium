        description: RS Ark grid build focusing on Force Orb casts and spamming Energy Bullet to extend Hype to allow for more Force Skills uses. This build should technically do more damage but is also the sweatiest of the bunch with higher uptime required and lower downtime, with added jank interactions with Energy Bullet near the end of Hype to be wary of.

          - Make sure you have one stack of Destiny before you enter Hype (can be leftover from last Hype) so that you get the refund on using your Force Orb Skill right away.
          - Make sure to spam Martial Arts Skills when Hype is recovering to shorten the window before you can enter it again.
          - Try to bomb off cooldown as much as possible unless you know that a big DPS window is coming.
          - Make sure to let your Energy Bullet go back up to 2 stacks while Hype is off, otherwise you get bugged cooldown.

            notes: |-
              **Force Skill**
              - Main purpose is to extend Hype by landing hits on the boss and to proc reduction to Energy Skills every 2 Destiny Skills.
              - Does decent damage for being so low cooldown
              - The Hype extension is per hit, do NOT miss this skill.
              - Oversupply is a very slight damage increase but Penetrating Pain has extra AOE that could make hits that were to miss end up hitting the boss.

            notes: |-
              **Force Skill**
              - You want to cast this as often as possible for this build as it is your main damage skill.
              - While it is your main damage skill, it does NOT have Paralysis Immunity, be careful when you use it.

              **Martial Art Skill**
              - Recovers a lot of energy per use.
              - Decently strong for being a martial art skill.
              - Lightning Fast can be used as 3rd tripod instead, the cast time goes from 0.8s to 0.7s, with epic vision, for a small damage decrease.
              - First Tripod is flexible, pick what you prefer, the energy is usually wasted on this build.

              - Same cooldown no matter how many charges you use.
              - Can be used with Galewind rune instead.
              - The Energy regenaration from Tireless is per cast, not per hit.

              **Utility, Counter**
              - You can drop Flash Step to level 7 if you prefer having more tripods on this skill, it can deal around 3% of damage distrubtion at level 10.
              - Counter will be the main use of this skill in this build as you do not need the extra energy from using it.
              - can be used with Quick Recharge Rune instead.

              - Short cooldown, aim for 1 cast per Hype

              - Strongest Awakening in the game.
              - Hyper Awakening can be used during Hype downtime, note that it will be a long cooldown if you do that so try to keep it for the last bomb you will throw in the fight.

        priorities:
          - After the opener, this build variant does not have a strict rotation; it operates according to the following guidelines for each of the stages in the identity (Z1, Z2, Z3).
          - Z1 - Use every skill once to generate meter. The priority is putting Skysplitting Fist + Merciless Pummel on cooldown. Use Rule the World if available.
          - Z2 - Try to use every skill once to generate meter as they come off of cooldown. If Skysplitting Fist and Merciless Pummel are 4+ seconds of cooldown left when meter is filled, move to Z3. Use Rule the World if available.
          - Z3 - Lead with Skysplitting Fist and Merciless Pummel if not used in Z2. Ideally use Flash Step x3 + Shadowbreaker + Celestial Palm + Yin Yang Palm to finish the gauge.
          - Do not use Skysplitting Fist and Merciless Pummel in Z3 if they are not the first two skills as this will put your meter generation in the next rotation in a deficit. If you are missing any meter from previous forms, you may need to use Illusion Strike + Bolting Crash to fill.
          - Prioritize Rule the World in Z1/Z2; do not use it in Z3 unless the boss is leaving and you need to fill the gauge now to send Z3.

          - Try to get at least 90% crit rate. Critical swapped into Master if below Crit Rate. Keen Sense swapped into Limit Break if above Crit Rate.
          - If you are overcapped on crit rate because of multiple additional crit sources, consider using Blunt Thorn to utilize the overcap.
